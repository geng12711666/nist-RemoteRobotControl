# nist-RemoteRobotControl
This repository contains codes for NIST IWS lab remote operational use case, which can remote control the robot arm on the wireless testbed to a target capacitive sensor. Meanwhile, a real-time camera stream and sensor signal will be feedback to the remote control end.

- Remember to set the $eventFileOutputPath to the location where you want the event recording file is
- Remember to add the c++ and python to your system path
    e.g. If winpython is used, add the winpython installation directory  (e.g., C:\WinPython) and Scripts subfolder within your WinPython installation (e.g., C:\WinPython\Scripts) to the system environment path variable
